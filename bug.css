The CSS property `content` is used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to insert generated content.  However, using it incorrectly, especially with complex selectors or values, can lead to unexpected rendering issues. For example, using incorrect units or escaping special characters incorrectly within the string can cause it to not render as expected.  Another issue is attempting to use `content` with a pseudo-element that isn't applied correctly or has no effect on an element.
