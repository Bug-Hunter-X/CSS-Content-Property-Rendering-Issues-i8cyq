# CSS Content Property Rendering Issues

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the CSS `content` property and its use with `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.  Specifically, it highlights scenarios where incorrect units, improper escaping, or selector misapplication leads to unexpected rendering behavior or failure to render the generated content.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.css` shows the corrected version.

## Problem:

The `content` property, when used incorrectly, can result in invisible or incorrectly displayed generated content. This might be due to:

* **Incorrect units:** Using units other than those expected (e.g., using `px` when a string is expected).
* **Incorrect character escaping:**  Not properly escaping special characters within the string value.
* **Selector issues:** The pseudo-element (`::before`, `::after`) might not be applied correctly, or the selector targeting the element may be faulty.

## Solution:

The solution involves carefully reviewing the `content` property's value, ensuring correct units (or lack thereof for string values), correctly escaping any special characters, and verifying the accuracy of the selector targeting the element.
